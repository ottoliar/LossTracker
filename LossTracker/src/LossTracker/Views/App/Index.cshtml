        <h1>Welcome to LossTracker</h1>
        <p>This is an app that helps you (or at least me!) track fitness and calorie goals.</p>
        <p>It was inspired in part after feeling particularly bloated the day after Thanksgiving.</p>
        <p>I created this app using C#/ASP.NET for server-side stuffs, and AngularJS for the front end.</p>
        <p>Please visit my GitHub to see the source code for this app!</p>
