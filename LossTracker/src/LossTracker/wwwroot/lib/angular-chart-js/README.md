## Angular Chart.js


### Documentation

To use this project checkout our [online documentation](http://charts.sysen.co.uk).


### Quick Overview

This project is a simple wrapper for the Chart.js library, allowing for easy integration into any Angular.js application.

The aim of this project is to allow both direct access to the charts and methods provided by the library, and a number of helper services for converting data to that required to produce various charts.


### Roadmap

1. Finish documentation site
2. Add data conversion services
3. Extensions for using angular filters with data
