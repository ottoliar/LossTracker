# LossTracker
[THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN DEPLOYED :)](http://losstracker.azurewebsites.net)

I created this app because I thought it would be a good opportunity to further develop 
my skills while building something at least a little cool and useful in the process.

Stack- ASP.NET, C#, Entity Framework, and AngularJS.  I had a good time planning out 
the server-side and making the API that would link it to the client.
